A program of a dice game called pig where the user plays against the computer with randomly rolled "dice".  Console prompts with rules and player options once executed.

Rules:
If the player/computer rolls a 1 the turn is over and any points not banked will be lost.  
If a player rolls a 2 through 6 that number is added to their temporary total.  The player then can choose to roll again or bank their points.  Once points have been banked the turn ends and the next player begins their roll.
First player to 100 wins.
