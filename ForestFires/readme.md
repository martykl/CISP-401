Created a program in Java that tests the burn rate based on number of fires started and probability of fires starting. When running, user will be prompted for fires started in a 12x12 square area and the probability of the fire spreading based on a percentage specified after prompt.

The fire is randomly placed in a position in the 12x12 area and all surrounding areas not already burning or burnt will be tested based on the probability. Each fire has one turn to burn before clearing the area and ending. The test will continue until all fires are burnt and percentage of forest burned as well as turns completed and a text based overview of the forest on each turn.

Display Keys: 
Periods (.) are cleared areas 
Asterisks (*) are fires still burning 
Hat (^) are trees unaffected
